Data on the percentage of pupils meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths by the age of 11 years, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

Disadvantaged children are less likely than non-disadvantaged children to reach the expected standard in reading, writing and maths by the end of key stage 2, when they are usually 11 years old.

The ‘disadvantage gap’ is wider now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. It went down in the 9 school years to July 2019. It then went up in the 2021 to 2022 school year to the highest level since 2012, and has since fallen slightly.

In the 2023 to 2024 school year:

* 61% of pupils met the expected standard – up from the previous school year (60%), but below the 2018 to 2019 school year (65%)
* 46% of disadvantaged pupils and 61% of non-disadvantaged pupils met the expected standard
* girls were more likely than boys to reach the expected standard, but the gap between pupils from disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged backgrounds was the same for girls and boys (22 percentage points)
* there were large variations between pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) in different ethnic groups – for example, 73% of FSM-eligible children in the Chinese ethnic group met the expected standard, compared with 14% of Gypsy or Roma children
* there were improvements for pupils in some Black and Asian ethnic groups – for example, 48% of Black African pupils met the expected standard, compared with 43% in the previous school year

            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
                        
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Department for Education (DfE). National curriculum assessments at key stage 2 in England, 2024.

### Time period
* September 2015 to July 2024 (By disadvantage status over time)
* September 2010 to July 2024 (By year)
* 2023 to 2024 school year (By area, sex and ethnicity)

### Geographic area
England

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of pupils who met the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at the end of key stage 2, when pupils are usually 11 years old.

Disadvantaged pupils are those who:

* were registered as eligible for free school meals at any point in the last 6 years
* are looked after by a local authority in England and Wales, or who left local authority care through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order

Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. Children are eligible for FSM if their parents receive certain benefits.

The ‘disadvantage gap index’ summarises the relative attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and all other pupils. It is based on their reading and maths assessments at the end of key stage 2.

Scores range from -10 to 10. A disadvantage gap score of 0 means there was no difference in achievement. A score greater than 0 means non-disadvantaged pupils did better than disadvantaged pupils. A score of 10 means that every non-disadvantaged pupil did better than every disadvantaged pupil.

### Things you need to know
Attainment for the most recent 2 years is not directly comparable with the 2 school years ending in July 2017. This is because of changes to teacher assessment frameworks in 2018. Data was not collected during the 2 school years ending in July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Type of data
Administrative data
