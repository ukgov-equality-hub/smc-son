Data on the percentage of 5 year olds who achieve a ‘good level of development’, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In the 7 school years ending in July 2019, the percentage of 5 year olds who achieved a good level of development (meeting at least the expected standard in the early years foundation stage) went up from 52% to 72%. It went down to 67% in the 2022 to 2023 school year.

In the 2022 to 2023 school year:

* 52% of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) and 72% of non-eligible pupils achieved a good level of development

* 78% of girls and 65% of boys achieved a good level of development – for pupils eligible for FSM, 60% of girls and 44% of boys achieved the level

* among FSM-eligible children from the same ethnic background, girls were much more likely to achieve a good level of development than boys

* FSM-eligible children from Black, Asian and Mixed ethnic backgrounds were more likely to achieve a good level of development than FSM-eligible White children

* FSM-eligible pupils in parts of London, Lincolnshire, and the West Midlands were the most likely out of all areas to to achieve a good level of development – pupils in the North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber were the least likely to

        [41 regions in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area#the-41-regions) are ranked from the lowest to highest percentages.
        They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        
        The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions.
        
        The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
        – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within.
        In many cases the confidence intervals overlap.
        This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
        
        See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to
        understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Department for Education. Early years foundation stage (EYFS) profile results from the 2022 to 2023 academic year, 2023.

### Time period
* 2022 to 2023 school year (By level of neighbourhood deprivation, area, sex and ethnicity)
* September 2012 to July 2023 (By eligibility for free school meals over time)

### Geographic area
England

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of pupils who achieved a ‘good level of development’ at 5 years old.

A child is classed as having a good level of development if they meet at least the expected standard in the early years foundation stage (EYFS).

### Things you need to know
The EYFS was updated in September 2021. This means data for the 2 school years ending in July 2023 is not directly comparable with data for earlier years.

Data was not collected during the 2 school years ending in July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. Children are eligible for FSM if their parents receive certain benefits.

Income deprivation affecting children index (IDACI) deciles are based on the percentage of children living in income-deprived households within a certain neighbourhood. These neighbourhoods are put into 10 groups (‘deciles’). Decile 1 is made up of the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods – decile 10 is the least deprived 10% of neighbourhoods.

### Type of data
Administrative data
