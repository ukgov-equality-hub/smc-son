Data on the percentage of 5 year olds who achieve a ‘good level of development’, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In the 7 school years ending in July 2019, the percentage of 5 year olds who achieved a good level of development (meeting at least the expected standard in the early years foundation stage) went up from 52% to 72%.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection restarted in the 2021 to 2022 school year, and the data is not comparable to previous years. 

In the 2023 to 2024 school year:

* 68% of children achieved a good level of development
* 52% of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM) and 72% of non-eligible pupils achieved a good level of development
* girls continued to outperform boys, and the gap between FSM-eligible pupils and those not eligible was also slightly smaller for girls
* among FSM-eligible children from the same ethnic background, girls were much more likely to achieve a good level of development than boys
* among FSM-eligible children, those from Black, Asian and Mixed ethnic backgrounds were more likely to achieve a good level of development than White children
* FSM-eligible pupils in parts of London, the West Midlands, and Shropshire and Staffordshire were the most likely out of all areas  to achieve a good level of development – pupils in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber were the least likely

There was a link between income deprivation and children achieving a good level of development. Neighbourhoods with higher rates of children living in income-deprived households had a lower percentage of children achieving a good level of development. In the 2023 to 2024 school year, 77% of 5 year olds in the least deprived neighbourhoods achieved a good level of development, compared with 58% in the most deprived neighbourhoods.

## About the data

### Data source
Department for Education (DfE). Early years foundation stage (EYFS) profile results from the 2023 to 2024 academic year, 2024.

### Time period
* 12 school years to July 2024 (By year)
* 2023 to 2024 school year (By area, sex, ethnicity, and level of neighbourhood deprivation)

### Geographic area
England

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of pupils who achieved a ‘good level of development’ at 5 years old.

A child is classed as having a good level of development if they meet at least the expected standard in the early years foundation stage (EYFS).

### Things you need to know
Data is only available for England.

The EYFS was updated in September 2021. This means data for the 3 school years ending in July 2024 is not directly comparable with data for earlier years.

Data was not collected during the 2 school years ending in July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by DfE. Children are eligible for FSM if their parents receive certain benefits.

Income deprivation affecting children index (IDACI) deciles are based on the percentage of children living in income-deprived households within a certain neighbourhood. These neighbourhoods are put into 10 groups (‘deciles’). Decile 1 is made up of the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods – decile 10 is the least deprived 10% of neighbourhoods.

### Type of data
Administrative data
