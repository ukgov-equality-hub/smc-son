Data on the percentage of pupils getting a pass (grade 5 or above) in GCSE English and maths, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In the 2023 to 2024 school year, 46.2% of pupils got a grade 5 or above in both English and maths – down from 45.5% in the previous school year.

26% of disadvantaged pupils and 53% of all other pupils got a grade 5 or above.

The ‘disadvantage gap index’ fell slightly from the previous year, where it was at its widest since the 2010 to 2011 school year. This index measures the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and all other pupils.

Girls were more likely than boys to get a grade 5 or above, regardless of their disadvantage status. For non-disadvantaged pupils, 56% of girls and 51% of boys got a grade 5 or above. For disadvantaged pupils, 28% of girls and 24% of boys got a grade 5 or above.

For pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM), those in London and the West Midlands were the most likely to get a grade 5 or above.

There were large variations between FSM-eligible pupils in different ethnic groups. For example, 76% of FSM-eligible pupils from the Chinese ethnic group got a grade 5 or above, compared with 6% of Gypsy or Roma pupils.

For FSM-eligible pupils, those from the Indian and Bangladeshi ethnic groups (both 50%) were more likely to get a grade 5 or above compared with White British (19%) and Mixed White and Black Caribbean (19%) pupils.

            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
                        
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Department for Education (DfE). National curriculum assessments at key stage 4 in England, 2024

### Time period
* September 2018 to July 2024 (By disadvantage status)
* September 2010 to July 2024 (By year)
* 2023 to 2024 academic year (By area, sex and ethnicity)

### Geographic area
England

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of children who got a pass (grade 5 or above) in both English and maths GCSEs by the end of key stage 4, when pupils are usually 16 years old.

Disadvantaged pupils are those who were:

* registered as eligible for free school meals (FSM) at any point in the last 6 years
* looked after by a local authority in England and Wales, or who left local authority care through adoption

Eligibility for FSM is used as an indicator of deprivation by DfE. Children are eligible for FSM if their parents receive certain benefits.

The ‘disadvantage gap index’ summarises the relative attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and all other pupils. It is based on the grades they got in GCSE English and maths.

Scores range from -10 to 10. A disadvantage gap score of 0 means there was no difference in achievement. A score greater than 0 means non-disadvantaged pupils did better than disadvantaged pupils. A score of 10 means that every non-disadvantaged pupil did better than every disadvantaged pupil.

### Things you need to know
Figures for the school year 2023 to 2024 are based on revised data. Figures for the school year ending in July 2019 and July 2023 are based on final data.

Summer exams were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, pupils’ grades were based on teacher assessments and centre assessments.

When comparing data over time, note that differences may be partly due to changes in the approach to grading, not only changes in pupil performance.

For data by year, the years shown are the year in which the academic year ends. For example, ‘2024’ refers to the 2023 to 2024 academic year.
