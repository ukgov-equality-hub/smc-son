# What the data measures
The data shows the patterns of upward career mobility into the professional classes (known as intra-generational mobility) for people aged 25 to 44 years in the UK.
<br>
Data is shown for the following socio-economic backgrounds:
<ul class="govuk-list">
<li>higher professional class</li>
<li>lower professional class</li>
<li>intermediate class</li>
<li>higher working class</li>
<li>lower working classes</li>
</ul>

These are based on the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), set by the ONS.

# Things you need to know

<br>

<ul class="govuk-list">
<li>age</li>
<li>age squared (to account for the changing importance of age as people get older)</li>
<li>survey year</li>
