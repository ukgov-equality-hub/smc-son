About the data

## Text
### Data source
Office for National Statistics (ONS), Labour Force Survey (LFS) from 2014 and 2021

### Time period
2014 and 2021

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of people born in 1989 who had a university degree by the ages of 25 and 32 years old,
by socio-economic background.

Data is shown for the following socio-economic backgrounds:

* professional class (combining the higher and lower professional classes)
* intermediate class
* working class (combining the higher and lower working classes)

These are based on the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC), set by the ONS.

### Things you need to know
Data is weighted using LFS probability weights.

The data compares 2 separate samples from surveys carried out in 2014 and 2021. It does not compare the same
individuals at different time points. 

The data includes people aged 25 years in the first group, as most young people have completed full-time education
and started work by that age.

### Type of data
