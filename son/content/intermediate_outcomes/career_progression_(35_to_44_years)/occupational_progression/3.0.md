Data on upward mobility into professional careers for men and women aged 25 to 44 in the UK, by socio-economic background and year.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In both time periods covered by the data – the 3 years to 2016, and the 3 years to 2024:

* men and women aged 25 to 44 years from professional socio-economic backgrounds were more likely than those from other socio-economic backgrounds to work in professional occupations
* people’s chances of working in the professional classes went up from 25 to 35 years old, and then slowed or went down in their late 30s and early 40s – the initial increase was greater for young people from professional backgrounds, and the decline is greater for young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

The probability of being in a professional occupation went up across all ages, socio-economic backgrounds and sexes between the 3 years to 2016 and the 3 years to 2024.

In the 3 years to 2016, there was no gap between men and women in the probability of being in a higher professional occupation at 25 years old, for all socio-economic backgrounds. 

In the 3 years to 2024, women had slightly higher chances than men of being in a professional job at 25 years old. 

By the age of 44 years old, men from all socio-economic backgrounds had a greater chance of being in a higher professional occupation than women.
