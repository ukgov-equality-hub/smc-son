Data on upward mobility into professional careers for men and women aged 25 to 44 in the UK, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

Men and women aged 25 to 44 years from professional socio-economic backgrounds are more likely than those from other socio-economic backgrounds to work in professional occupations.

Peopleâ€™s chances of working in the professional classes go up from 25 to 35 years old, and then slow in their late 30s and early 40s. This increase is greater for young people from professional backgrounds while the decline is greater for young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
