        #### Index of 'promising prospects', by region (UK, 2018 to 2022 combined)

       [203 local authority areas in the UK] are put into 5 categories based on their ‘index of promising prospects’ composite scores. The categories are not equally sized – the middle category is larger because most local authorities are very near the average. Areas with the highest scores have the most favourable prospects for young people.

## Summary main findings
Young people brought up in some London boroughs – as well as in Surrey, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire – have the most ‘promising prospects’. This means they tend to have higher qualifications, earn more, and be in higher occupation levels by 25 to 29 years old.

Outside London and the home counties, Cheshire East and Warwickshire also have promising prospects for young people.

There are less favourable prospects for young people who grew up in some parts of the North East, including:

* Newcastle upon Tyne
* Sunderland
* Gateshead
* Hartlepool
* South Tyneside
* Northumberland
* Durham

## About the data

### Data source(s)

Labour Force Survey (LFS), Office for National Statistics

### Time period

2018 to 2022 combined

### Geographic area

UK

### What the data measures
This page combines data from the following 3 indicators into a single 'composite' score:

* [Highest qualification](/intermediate_outcomes/routes_into_work_(16_to_29_years)/highest_qualification) – data on young people with university degrees
* [Occupational level of young people aged 25 to 29 years](/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/occupational_level_of_young_people_aged_25_to_29_years) – data on young people in professional occupations
* [Earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years](/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/earnings_of_young_people_aged_25_to_29_years) – data on young people's earnings at work

The index of promising prospects adjusts for socio-economic background, and measures how well young people from similar backgrounds do in education and employment.
