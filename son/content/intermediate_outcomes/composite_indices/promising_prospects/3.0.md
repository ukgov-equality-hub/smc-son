        #### Index of 'promising prospects', by local authority (UK)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            [203 local authority areas in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area/latest#list-of-uk-regions)
            are put into 5 categories based on their ‘index of promising prospects’ composite scores.
            The categories are not equally sized – the middle category is larger because most local authorities are very near the average.
            Areas with the highest scores have the most favourable prospects for young people.

## Summary main findings
Most local authorities have scores near to the average on the index of promising prospects – this means there is little difference between them.

Young people brought up in some London boroughs – as well as the Surrey county council, Hertfordshire county council and Buckinghamshire county council areas – have the most ‘promising prospects’. This means they tend to have higher qualifications, earn more, and be in higher occupation levels by 25 to 44 years old.

Outside London and the home counties, Cheshire East and Warwickshire county council area also have promising prospects for young people.

There are less favourable prospects for young people who grew up in some parts of the North East, including:

* Newcastle upon Tyne
* Sunderland
* Gateshead
* Hartlepool
* South Tyneside
* Northumberland county council
* Durham county council

## About the data

### Data source(s)

Labour Force Survey (LFS), Office for National Statistics

### Time period

2018 to 2022 combined

### Geographic area

UK

### What the data measures
This index brings together 4 measures of promising prospects for young people, as measured by their levels of education, occupational positions and earnings. 

This page combines data from the following 4 measures into a single 'composite' score:

* Highest qualification – net levels of a university degree among young people in each area after controlling for socio-economic background (SEB)
* Occupational level of 25 to 44 year olds (professional class occupation) – net percentages of people in professional class jobs in each area after controlling for SEB
* Occupational level of 25 to 44 year olds (working class occupation) – net percentages of people in working class jobs in each area after controlling for SEB
* Earnings of 25 to 44 year olds – mean hourly earnings among people in each area after controlling for SEB

The index of promising prospects adjusts for socio-economic background, and measures how well young people from similar backgrounds do in education and employment.

### Things you need to know
The areas shown are where respondents lived when they were aged 14 years.

To increase the number of survey respondents, we have combined the ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ professional classes into a single category. We have done the same with the ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ working classes.

Data constraints mean that Northern Ireland has to be treated as a single unit. Local authorities have had to be combined in a few other cases.

The unit used for this index is the 'Z-score'. This is a type of statistical measurement which can be used to tell us how likely it is that a region is different to the UK average. 

The values shown are not percentages, and the difference between regions cannot be compared in percentage terms. 

The Z-scores are used to put regions into one of five groups, according to a set of thresholds for each group. Please see our [technical annex](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-nation-2024-local-to-national-mapping-opportunities-for-all/technical-annex) for more information on how each area was scored.
