Summary main findings

## Text
Young people brought up in densely-populated urban areas – including London – tend to have more difficult economic circumstances than young people in rural areas.

## Text
London also has a high percentage of young people with <a href="/intermediate_outcomes/composite_indices/promising_prospects" class="govuk-link">promising prospects</a>.

Some areas – for example, Eastern Scotland – do worse for both young people's good prospects and difficult economic circumstances.

About the data

## Text
This page combines data from the following 3 indicators into a single ‘composite’ score to give a more reliable picture of geographical mobility patterns:

<ul class="govuk-list list-disc">
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/economic_activity" class="govuk-link">Economic inactivity</a> – data on young people not in education or in employment</li>
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/unemployment" class="govuk-link">Unemployment</a> – data on young people not in employment</li>
    <li><a href="/intermediate_outcomes/work_in_early_adulthood_(25_to_29_years)/occupational_level" class="govuk-link">Occupational level</a> – data on young people in lower working class occupations</li>
</ul>

## Text
The data is adjusted for socio-economic background, so it measures how precarious the situations are of young people from similar social backgrounds.<br>

Indicators are rescaled to make sure they use a common metric. The best-performing area’s score is set to 1, and the least well-performing area’s score is set to 0. <br>

See the [technical annex] for more information on how each area was scored.
