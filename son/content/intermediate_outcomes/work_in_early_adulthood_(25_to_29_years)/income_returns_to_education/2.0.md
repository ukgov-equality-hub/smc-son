Data on the effect of different levels of education on the earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

Higher education levels among young people (25 to 29 year olds) are linked with higher earnings. 

Young people with a higher degree – such as a master’s degree – earned 58% more than those from the same socio-economic background with no GCSEs. Young people with an undergraduate degree earned 48% more.

For people with all qualifications except higher degrees and GCSEs (or equivalent), earnings went up significantly between 2014 and 2022. Earnings went up by:

* 16.0% for people with lower level qualifications
* 15.3% for people with further education qualifications
* 12.2% for people with undergraduate degrees

The earnings gap between young people with different education levels has stayed mostly the same. It has got smaller between young people with:

* undergraduate degrees and higher degrees
* GCSEs (and equivalent) and lower level qualifications

Young women earned significantly less than young men with the same qualifications and socio-economic background.

Young people from most ethnic minority groups earned around the same as White British young people with the same qualifications and socio-economic background. Young people from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups earned less.

Disabled young people earned significantly less than those without a disability with the same qualifications. For people with an undergraduate degree, young disabled people earned 86% of the earnings of those without a disability.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
2020 to 2022 combined (By education level)

2014 to 2022 (By year)

2014 to 2022 combined (By sex, ethnicity and disability status)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the effect of different levels of education on the earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years in the UK.

### Things you need to know
This year’s estimates are not directly comparable to those in last year’s report. This is due to changes to the methodology and the inflation base year.

Data is weighted using LFS person weights. Earnings are adjusted for inflation with a base year of 2022.

Percentage differences were estimated from a linear regression model of log hourly earnings, by educational level controlling for socio-economic background, sex and age.

For data by education level, the percentages shown are the differences in income for men aged 27 from lower working class backgrounds by level of qualification, compared with similar men with lower level qualifications (below GCSE grade 1 or equivalent). Data from 2020 to 2022 is combined to get more accurate estimates.

For data by year, sex, ethnicity and disability, the estimates shown are the hourly earnings of 27-year-old men from a lower working-class background. Data from 2014 to 2022 is combined.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).
