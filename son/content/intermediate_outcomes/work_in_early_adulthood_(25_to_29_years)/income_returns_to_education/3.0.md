Data on the effect of different levels of education on the earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

Higher education levels among young people (25 to 29 year olds) are linked with higher earnings.

Young people with a higher degree – such as a master’s degree – earned 41% more than those from the same socio-economic background with no GCSEs. Young people with an undergraduate degree earned 27% more.

The gaps between young people with different qualification levels have mostly persisted over time. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, young people with lower educational qualifications have had a slightly faster increase in income than young people with higher qualifications. This does not mean they earn more – just that their income has increased faster, making the gap narrower. Overall, higher education levels still lead to higher earnings.

Young women earned significantly less than young men with the same qualifications and socio-economic background.

Young people from most ethnic minority groups earned around the same as White British young people with the same qualifications and socio-economic background. Young people from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups earned less.

Young people with a disability earned less than those without a disability but with the same qualifications. For young people with an undergraduate degree, those with a disability earned 90% of the earnings of those without a disability.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
* 2020 to 2024 combined (By education level)
* 2014 to 2024, 3-year averages (Changes over time)
* 2014 to 2024 combined (By sex, ethnicity and disability status)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the effect of different levels of education on the earnings of young people aged 25 to 29 years in the UK.

### Things you need to know
This year’s estimates are not directly comparable to those in State of the Nation 2024. This is due to changes to the methodology and the inflation base year to 2024. 

Data is weighted using LFS income weights.

For data by education level, the percentages shown are the differences in income for men aged 27 from lower working class backgrounds by level of qualification, compared with similar men with lower level qualifications (below GCSE grade 1 or equivalent). Data from 2020 to 2024 is combined to get more accurate estimates.

For data by year, ethnicity and disability, the estimates shown are the hourly earnings of 27-year-old men from a lower working-class background. Data by year is combined into 3-year averages (for example, 2020 to 2022). Data by ethnicity and disability is combined from 2014 to 2024.

For data by sex, the estimates shown are the hourly earnings of 27-year-old men and women from a lower working-class background. Data from 2014 to 2024 is combined.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).
