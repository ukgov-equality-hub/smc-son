Data on the average earnings of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In 2024, young people aged 25 to 29 earned £17.10 an hour on average.

Young people’s socio-economic background was strongly related to their level of earnings. Young people from lower working class backgrounds earned £14.50 an hour on average, compared with £19.10 for those from higher professional backgrounds.

Average earnings for 25 to 29 year olds have gone up slightly over time, even after accounting for inflation. But the increases have been very small – for example, mean hourly earnings have increased by just £1 in the last decade.

Over the last 10 years, the difference in earnings between people from different socio-economic backgrounds has remained constant, with the class gaps looking fairly similar over time. 

Across all socio-economic backgrounds:

* young men earned more than young women – this earnings gap was the same across all socio-economic backgrounds
* 25 to 29 year olds from Black African, Chinese and Indian ethnic backgrounds earned significantly more than White British young people
* 25 to 29 year olds with a disability earned significantly less than those without a disability

        #### Difference in weekly earnings of 25 to 29 year olds, compared to the national average (UK, 2018 to 2024 combined)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

### What the data measures
The data show the mean (average) earnings of people aged 25 to 29 in the UK, by socio-economic background.

### Things you need to know
Self-employed respondents and those without earnings are excluded. Earnings have been adjusted for inflation with a base year of 2024.

This year’s data is not directly comparable to last year’s. This is due to changes in the inflation base year.

Data is weighted using the LFS person weights.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).

Data by sex, ethnicity and disability status from 2014 to 2024 is combined to get more accurate estimates. Data by area from 2018 to 2024 is combined.

For the over time analysis, we use a 3-year moving average. The first data point covers 2014 to 2016, and the final data point covers 2022 to 2024. A formal test was conducted for differences in the socio-economic background gap between 2014 and 2024. This was not significant.

For data by ethnicity, the percentages shown are those for men. Percentages are shown only for those with lower working-class and higher professional-class backgrounds for comparison, but all socio-economic backgrounds were included in the analysis.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010. Among people with a disability, those in work are a more selective group because their inactivity rate is higher.
