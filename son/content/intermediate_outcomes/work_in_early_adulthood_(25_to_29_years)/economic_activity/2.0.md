Data on the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds who are either in work or looking for work, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In 2022, 87% of all 25 to 29 year olds were economically active, meaning they were either in work or looking for work.

80% of 25 to 29 year olds from lower working class backgrounds were economically active – the lowest percentage out of all socio-economic backgrounds. Percentages in all other socio-economic groups were between 87% and 90%.

Data for 2014 to 2022 combined shows that:

* young women were less likely to be economically active than young men from the same socio-economic background – the gap was largest in the lower working class group, where 71% of young women and 86% of young men were economically active

* young people from Bangladeshi, Black African, Pakistani, Chinese, Indian, Mixed and Other ethnic groups had significantly lower levels of economic activity compared with young white British people from similar socio-economic backgrounds.

* disabled young people were less likely to be economically active than non-disabled young people from the same socio-economic background – the ‘disability gap’ was relatively small among those from a higher professional background

        #### Percentage point difference in the likelihood of being economically active at 25 to 29 years old, compared to the national average (UK, 2018 to 2022 combined) {: class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"}

        [41 regions in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area#the-41-regions) are ranked from the lowest to highest
        percentage point difference to the national average.
        They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        
        The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions.
        
        The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
        – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within.
        In many cases the confidence intervals overlap.
        This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
        
        See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to
        understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
2022 (By socio-economic background)
2014 to 2022 combined (By sex, ethnicity and disability status)
2018 to 2022 combined (By area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK who were ‘economically active’, by socio-economic background.

Someone is ‘economically active’ if they are either in work, or available for and actively looking for work.

People can be economically inactive if they are:

* in full-time education
* looking after family
* unable to work due to disability or ill health

### Things you need to know
Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

For data by ethnicity, the estimated percentages are those for men. Percentages are shown only for people from lower working class and higher professional class backgrounds.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](https://social-mobility.data.gov.uk/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).

### Type of data
