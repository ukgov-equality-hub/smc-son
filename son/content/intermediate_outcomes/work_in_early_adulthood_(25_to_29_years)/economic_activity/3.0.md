Data on the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds who are either in work or looking for work, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In 2024, 80% of 25 to 29 year olds from lower working class backgrounds were economically active – the lowest percentage out of all socio-economic backgrounds. Percentages in all other socio-economic groups were between 88% and 91%.

In the 3 years to 2024, an average of 88% of 25 to 29 year olds were economically active – up from 86% in the 3 years to 2016. The gap in economic activity between men and women went down from 15 to 7 percentage points over this period. 

Data for 2014 to 2024 combined shows that:

* young women were less likely to be economically active than young men from the same socio-economic background – the gap was largest in the lower working class group, where 72% of young women and 86% of young men were economically active
* young people from the Black Caribbean ethnic group had the highest rates of economic activity compared with those in other ethnic groups from similar socio-economic backgrounds – 92% of those from lower working backgrounds and 97% from higher professional backgrounds were economically active
* young people from the Chinese ethnic group has the lowest rates – 63% of those from lower working backgrounds and 82% of those from higher professional backgrounds were economically active
* among young White British people, 86% from lower working backgrounds and 94% from higher professional backgrounds were economically active
* young people with a disability were less likely to be economically active than those without a disability from the same socio-economic background – the ‘disability gap’ was largest for those with working class backgrounds, at 38 percentage points

        #### Percentage point difference in the likelihood of being economically active at 25 to 29 years old, compared to the national average (UK, 2018 to 2024 combined)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
* 2024 (By socio-economic background)
* 2014 to 2024 (3-year averages, changes over time)
* 2014 to 2024 combined (By sex, ethnicity, and disability status)
* 2018 to 2024 combined (By area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK who were ‘economically active’, by socio-economic background.

Someone is economically active if they are either in work, or available for and actively looking for work.

People can be economically inactive if they are:

* in full-time education
* looking after family
* unable to work due to disability or ill health

### Things you need to know
Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

For over time analysis, we use a 3-year moving average. The first data point covers 2014 to 2016, and the final data point covers 2022 to 2024. A formal test was conducted for differences in the socio-economic background gap between 2014 and 2024. This was significant for both men and women.

For data by ethnicity, the estimated percentages are those for men. Percentages are shown only for people from lower working class and higher professional class backgrounds.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).
