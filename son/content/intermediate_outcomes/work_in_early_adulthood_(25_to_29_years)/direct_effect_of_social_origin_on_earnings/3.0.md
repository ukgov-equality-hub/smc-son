Data on how young people’s socio-economic background affects their earnings.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

25 to 29 year olds from professional backgrounds earn significantly more than those from other backgrounds but with the same qualifications.

In the 3 years to 2024, young people from higher professional backgrounds earned 19% more than those from a lower working class background with the same qualification level.

The earnings gap between young people from different socio-economic backgrounds has stayed mostly the same. In the 3 years to 2024, the gap between young people from higher professional and lower working class backgrounds was around £2.30 an hour.

Between the 3 years to 2016 and the 3 years to 2024, earnings went up significantly for young people from:

* higher working socio-economic class backgrounds (up by 25%)
* lower working socio-economic class backgrounds (up by 23%)
* intermediate socio-economic backgrounds (up by 29%)

Data for 2014 to 2024 combined shows that: 

* young men and women with the same qualifications and socio-economic background earned very similar amounts – the gap in earnings between men and women was largest for those from a lower working class background
* young people from most ethnic minority groups earned around the same as White British young people from the same socio-economic background, except for those from the Bangladeshi ethnic group who earned significantly less than all other groups
* in every ethnic group, young people from higher professional backgrounds earned more than those from lower working class backgrounds
* young people with a disability earned less than those without a disability with the same qualifications and socio-economic background – the size of the earnings gap between young people with a disability and those without was similar across socio-economic backgrounds except lower working backgrounds (probably due to the minimum wage)

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS) 

### Time period
* 2022 to 2024 combined (By socio-economic background)
* 2014 to 2024, 3-year averages (Changes over time)
* 2014 to 2024 combined (By sex, ethnicity and disability status)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the effect of young people’s socio-economic background on their earnings. ‘Young people’ in the data are 25 to 29 years old.

### Things you need to know
This year’s estimates are not directly comparable to those in last year’s report. This is due to changes to the methodology and the inflation base year to 2024. Data is weighted using LFS income weights.

The reference group is men aged 27 with lower level qualifications (below GCSE grade 1 or equivalent). For data by sex, estimates are shown for people with the lowest levels of education and aged 27 years. For data by ethnicity, the linear regression model assumes that class effects are the same within each ethnic group.

For data by socio-economic background, data from 2022 to 2024 is combined to get more accurate estimates.

For data by year, data is combined into rolling 3-year averages (for example, 2022 to 2024).

For data by sex, ethnicity and disability, data from 2014 to 2024 is combined.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).
