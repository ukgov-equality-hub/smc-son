Data on the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds who were unemployed, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In 2024, 25 to 29 year olds from lower working class backgrounds had the highest unemployment rate (6%) out of all socio-economic backgrounds. Those from higher professional backgrounds had the lowest rate (2%). 

In the 3 years to 2024, 3.8% of 25 to 29 year olds were unemployed – down from 5.8% in the 3 years to 2016. Average unemployment rates went up slightly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the 3 years to 2024, 25 to 29 year olds from lower working class backgrounds were twice as likely to be unemployed as those from higher professional backgrounds. 

There were no differences above 1% in unemployment rates between young men and women from the same socio-economic backgrounds.

Young people from White British and White Other ethnic backgrounds were the least likely to be unemployed. 

Young people with a disability were significantly more likely to be unemployed than young people without a disability from the same socio-economic background.

        #### Percentage point difference in the likelihood of being unemployed at 25 to 29 years old, by region compared to the national average (UK, 2018 to 2024 combined)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK who were unemployed, by socio-economic background.

### Things you need to know
Unemployed people are defined as not in work but available for and looking for work. Economically inactive people (those not in work or looking for work) are not included in the data.

Sample sizes for people who are unemployed are relatively small. Reports such as [Has labour market data become less reliable?](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/has-labour-market-data-become-less-reliable/) (House of Commons, 2023) have looked at how representative the LFS sample is for analysing labour market outcomes.

The data used is weighted using LFS person weights.

For changes over time, we use a 3-year moving average. The first data point covers 2014 to 2016, and the final data point covers 2022 to 2024. A formal test was conducted to test for differences between those from a higher professional socio-economic background and other socio-economic backgrounds. This was significant for all groups other than the lower professional group.

For data by ethnicity, the estimated percentages are those for men. Percentages are shown only for those with lower working-class and higher professional-class backgrounds.

The LFS uses the occupation of the main earner in the household when the respondent was aged 14 years for their socio-economic background.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010.
