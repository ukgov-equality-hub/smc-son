# Unemployment

Data on the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds who were unemployed, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In 2021, 5% of all 25 to 29 year olds in the UK were unemployed.

There were no significant differences in unemployment among 25 to 29 year olds from different socio-economic backgrounds.

There were no significant differences in unemployment rates between young men and women from the same socio-economic backgrounds.

Young people from the Pakistani and Black ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be unemployed than
White British young people from the same socio-economic background.

Disabled young people were around 3 times more likely to be unemployed than those without a disability, across all
socio-economic backgrounds.

        #### Likelihood of being unemployed at 25 to 29 years old, by region compared to the national average (UK, 2014 to 2021 combined) {: class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"}

        [41 regions in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area#the-41-regions) are ranked from the lowest to highest
        likelihood of being unemployed compared to the UK average. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        
        For example, the value for Eastern Scotland (1.89) means that 25 to 29 year olds in that area are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the UK average. The value for Devon (0.56) means they are just over half as likely to be unemployed.
        
        The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions.
        
        The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
        – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within.
        In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
        
        See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to
        understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
2014 to 2021 combined

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK who were unemployed, by socio-economic background.

### Things you need to know
Unemployed people are defined as not in work but available for and looking for work.
Economically inactive people (those not in work or looking for work) are excluded from the data.

The data used is weighted using LFS probability weights. The charts show 95% confidence intervals.

The estimated percentages and confidence intervals result from a logistic regression model on the likelihood of being
unemployed by ethnic group and socio-economic background, controlling for sex. The model assumes that class effects are
the same within each ethnic group. A formal test confirms this assumption.

For data by ethnicity, the estimated percentages are those for men. Percentages are shown only for those with
lower working-class and higher professional-class backgrounds for illustrative purposes.

The LFS uses the occupation of the main earner in the household when the respondent was aged 14 years when reporting
socio-economic background.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or
more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities.
This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. These intervals show where we expect the true value from a population to
be 95% of the time. For example, a confidence interval with the range of values from 5 to 10 implies that there is a
95% chance that the true population value is between 5 and 10, and a 5% chance that it is outside of this range.
The narrower the confidence interval or range, the more precise the estimate. Read more about
[confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
