Data on the occupational class people are in at 25 to 29 years old, by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

Young people’s socio-economic background is strongly linked to their occupational level when they are 25 to 29 years old. There has been little change in this link since 2014.

In 2022, 32% of 25 to 29 year olds from a higher professional background were in a higher professional occupation, compared with 7% of those from a lower working class background.

34% of young people from a lower working class background worked in a lower working class occupation, compared with 12% of those from a higher professional background.

Data for 2014 to 2022 combined shows that young women were less likely to be in higher professional occupations than young men from the same socio-economic background. They were more likely to be in lower professional occupations.

For example, among young people from higher professional backgrounds:

* 21% of young women and 29% of young men were in higher professional occupations
* 37% of young women and 31% of young men were in lower professional occupations

Compared with young White British people from the same socio-economic background, young people from Pakistani, Other and White Other ethnic groups had significantly lower chances of being in professional occupations.

Young people with a disability were more likely to be in a lower working class occupation than people without a disability but with the same socio-economic background.

        #### Percentage point difference in the likelihood of being in a professional occupation at 25 to 29 years old, compared to the national average (UK, 2018 to 2022 combined)

            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
* 2022 (By socio-economic background)
* 2014 to 2022 combined (By sex, by ethnicity, by disability status)
* 2018 to 2022 combined (By area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the occupation level of 25 to 29 year olds in the UK, by socio-economic background.

We use the following 5 categories of socio-economic background and occupational level:

* higher professional and managerial
* lower professional and managerial
* intermediate
* higher working class
* lower working class

These are based on the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (‘NS-SEC’), set by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

### Things you need to know
Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).

For data by sex, ethnicity and disability status, data from 2014 to 2022 is combined to get more accurate estimates. Data by area from 2018 to 2022 is combined.

The data by ethnicity shows whether young people are in a professional occupation (either higher or lower professional). Percentages are shown only for people from lower working class and higher professional backgrounds. This is because the number of people surveyed was too small to measure all socio-economic backgrounds and occupation levels reliably. The estimated percentages are those for men.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010. 

Areas are based on where the respondents were living when they were aged 14.
