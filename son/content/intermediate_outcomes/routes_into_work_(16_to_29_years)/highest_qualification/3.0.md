Data on the highest qualification achieved by young people (25 to 29 year olds), by socio-economic background.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

There is a strong relationship between people's socio-economic background and the highest qualification they get by their mid to late 20s. These inequalities are bigger for higher degrees (such as master's degrees or PhDs) than for first degrees (such as Bachelor degrees).

In 2024, 70% of 25 to 29 year olds from higher professional backgrounds had a first or higher degree, compared with 32% of those from lower working class backgrounds.

In the 3 years to 2024, an average of 52% of 25 to 29 year olds had a first or higher degree – up from 40% in the 3 years to 2016. Over this period, the gap in higher degree attainment between those from lower working-class and higher professional backgrounds went up from 18 to 20 percentage points. The gap in first degree attainment went down from 28 to 24 percentage points. 

Data for 2014 to 2024 combined shows that: 

* young women from every socio-economic background were more likely to have a first degree or higher degree than young men from the same socio-economic background
* out of all combinations of sex and socio-economic background, young men from lower working-class backgrounds were the least qualified, with 22% having a first or higher degree
* young women from higher professional backgrounds were the most qualified, with 73% having a first or higher degree
* 25 to 29 year olds from every ethnic minority group were more likely to have degrees than White British people from the same socio-economic background
* young people with a disability from every socio-economic background were less likely to have a university degree than those without a disability – they were also more likely to have lower-level qualifications

        #### Percentage point difference in the likelihood of having achieved a degree by the age of 25 to 29, compared to the national average (UK, 2018 to 2024 combined)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
* 2014 to 2024 (3-year averages, changes over time)
* 2024 (by socio-economic background)
* 2014 to 2024 combined (by sex, ethnicity and disability status)
* 2018 to 2024 combined (by area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the highest qualification achieved by young people aged 25 to 29 years in the UK, by socio-economic background.

### Things you need to know
People’s socio-economic background is measured by the occupation of the main earner in their household when they were 14 years old.

For data by ethnicity, the data shows whether young people had a university degree or not. This is because the number of people surveyed was too small to measure some qualification levels reliably. The percentages shown are those for men. Percentages are shown only for people from lower working-class and higher professional-class backgrounds.

For data by disability status, respondents were asked if they had a health condition or illness lasting 12 months or more, and if that condition reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This is consistent with the definition of disability in the Equality Act 2010.

For data by area, the areas are where respondents lived when they were 14 years old.

Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

For changes over time, we use a 3-year moving average. The first data point covers 2014 to 2016, and the final data point covers 2022 to 2024. A formal test was conducted for differences in the SEB gap between 2014 and 2024. This was not significant.

Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.

Error bars on charts show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).
