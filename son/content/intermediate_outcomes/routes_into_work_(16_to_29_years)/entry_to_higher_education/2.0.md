## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2022

### Time period
2022

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 18 to 20 year olds in the UK who began studying in higher education (HE) from 2014 to 2022. HE includes degree level qualifications and foundation degrees. 

### Things you need to know
The data is weighted using the LFS person weights. The error bars show 95% [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).

The ratios are the percentage of 18 to 20 year olds from higher professional backgrounds in HE, divided by the percentage from lower working backgrounds.

A logistic regression model was used to test differences in the likelihood of being in HE by socio-economic background. The difference in entry rates between people from lower professional and higher professional backgrounds was only significant at the 10% level.
