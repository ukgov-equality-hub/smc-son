## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2022

### Time period
* 2014 to 2024, 3-year averages (Changes over time)
* 2024 (By socio-economic background)
* 2014 to 2024 (By year)
* 2014 and 2024 (By socio-economic background – ratio over time)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 18 to 20 year olds in the UK who began studying in higher education (HE) from 2014 to 2024. HE includes degree level qualifications and foundation degrees.

### Things you need to know
The data is weighted using the LFS person weights. 

For changes over time, we use a 3-year moving average. The first data point covers the 3 years from 2014 to 2016, and the final data point covers 2022 to 2024. A formal test was conducted for differences in the socio-economic background gap between 2016 and 2024. The reduction in the gap between 18 to 20 year olds in the lower working and higher professional classes was significant.

The ratios are the percentage of 18 to 20 year olds from higher professional backgrounds in HE, divided by the percentage from lower working backgrounds.
