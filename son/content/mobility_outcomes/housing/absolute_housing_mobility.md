## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS)

### Time period
2016 to 2020 (combined)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the relationship in home ownership between people aged 25 to 64 years in the UK and their parents.

### Things you need to know
Data is weighted using the WAS individual weights.

Data analysed by area uses the area where respondents live now, not where they grew up.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. These intervals show where we expect the true value from a population to
be 95% of the time. For example, a confidence interval with the range of values from 5 to 10 implies that there is a
95% chance that the true population value is between 5 and 10, and a 5% chance that it is outside of this range.
The narrower the confidence interval or range, the more precise the estimate. Read more about
[confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)

### Type of data
Survey data
