About the data

## Text
### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS)

### Time period
2016 to 2020 (combined)

### Geographic area
England, Scotland and Wales

### What the data measures
The data shows wealth estimates for 25 to 64 year olds in England, Scotland and Wales.

Wealth is the value of different types of assets owned by households minus any liabilities, such as mortgages.

It includes:

* property wealth, including the value of property minus any mortgage owed
* pension wealth, including the value of occupational and private pensions
* physical wealth, including the value of household contents, valuables and vehicles
* financial wealth, including the value of financial assets

### Things you need to know
Data is adjusted for inflation, and weighted using WAS individual weights.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. These intervals show where we expect the true value from a population to
be 95% of the time. For example, a confidence interval with the range of values from 5 to 10 implies that there is a
95% chance that the true population value is between 5 and 10, and a 5% chance that it is outside of this range.
The narrower the confidence interval or range, the more precise the estimate. Read more about
[confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
