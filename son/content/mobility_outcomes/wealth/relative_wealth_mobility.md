## About the data
# Data source
Office for National Statistics, Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS)

# Time period
2016 to 2020 (combined)

# Geographic area
England, Scotland and Wales

# What the data measures
The data shows wealth estimates for 25 to 64 year olds in England, Scotland and Wales.

Wealth is the value of different types of assets owned by households minus any liabilities, such as mortgages.

It includes:
<ul class="govuk-list">
<li>property wealth, including the value of property minus any mortgage owed</li>
<li>pension wealth, including the value of occupational and private pensions</li>
<li>physical wealth, including the value of household contents, valuables and vehicles</li>

# Things you need to know

Respondents were asked about their parents’ housing and education. Estimates of parents’ wealth are based on the relationships between education, home ownership and wealth. 

Data is adjusted for inflation, and weighted using WAS individual weights.
