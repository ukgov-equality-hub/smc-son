About the data

## Text
### Data source
Manduca and others (2020). Trends in absolute income mobility in North America and Europe.

### Time period
1960 to 1987 (people’s year of birth)

### Geographic area
UK and internationally

### What the data measures
The data shows estimates of upward absolute income mobility for people born between 1960 and 1987.

The upward absolute mobility rate is the percentage of children in each year (‘birth cohort’) whose family income
at 30 years old was higher than their parents’ family income at 30 years old.

### Things you need to know
Income is calculated before tax but after benefits, and adjusted for inflation. Incomes for each country are based
on both register and survey data.

### Type of data
Survey data
