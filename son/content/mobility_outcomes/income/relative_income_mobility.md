Summary main findings

## Text
The link between parents’ and children's incomes got stronger between 1991 and 2004, and has remained at a similar level since.

The link is lower when the respondents’ income is measured during their 20s. It increases in their 30s and 40s, before going down again at age 50.

### What the data measures
The data shows the link between parents’ and children’s incomes at different ages, over time.

### Things you need to know
The 1975 to 1978 study measured the weekly earnings of fathers and sons. The age of the sons was not specified.

The 1991 study measured parents’ household income and their children’s earnings at 33 years old.

The 2004 study measured parents’ household income and their children’s earnings at 34 years old.

The 2009 to 2016 study measured parents’ gross household income and their children’s gross household income at 25 years of age or older.

The 2020 study measured parent’s gross household income and their children’s gross personal income at 25 years of age or older.

There are differences between the data and methodology of the different studies, which makes comparisons between them difficult.
The 1991 and 2004 studies are closest in methodology and safest to compare.
The estimates are likely to be underestimates of the likely strength of the link between parents’ and children’s income.
