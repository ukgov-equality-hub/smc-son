Data on the percentage of people taking part in civic democratic processes in England.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In the year to March 2021, 41.3% of people in England took part in civic democratic processes, both in person
and online, including signing a petition or attending a public rally.

In the 8 years to March 2021, levels of civic engagement were lowest in the year to March 2016, at 33.3%.

Between 2014 and 2021, the percentage of people who took part in civic democratic processes remained broadly the same,
at around 40%. There were slight increases following the Brexit referendum and outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
but it is not clear if these events and increases are connected.
