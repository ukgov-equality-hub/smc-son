## About the data

### Data source
Department for Education, Participation in education, training and employment

### Time period
2011 to 2023

### Geographic area
England

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of young people aged 16 to 18 years old in education, training and employment in England.

### Things you need to know
A person identified as NEET is either unemployed or economically inactive. Previous data includes a small number of students in further or higher education and work-based learning at the same time. The total number of young people in training excludes this group.

Since 2013, 16 to 17 year olds in England have been legally required to stay in education and training.

These findings are not comparable to those in last year’s report. This is because the figures from 2011 to 2022 have been revised to include improved population estimates.

Due to rounding, not all totals add up to 100%.

### Type of data
Administrative data
