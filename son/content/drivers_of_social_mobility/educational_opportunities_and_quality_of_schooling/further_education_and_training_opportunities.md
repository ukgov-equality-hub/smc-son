## About the data
# Data source(s)
Department for Education, Participation in education, training and employment, 2022

# Time period
2011 to 2021

# Geographic area
England

# What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of young people aged 16 to 18 years old in education, training and employment in England, from 2011 to 2021.

# Things you need to know
A person identified as NEET is either unemployed or economically inactive. In previous data, there have been very small overlaps of students studying in further or higher education, and work-based learning at the same time. The total number of young people in training is calculated by removing these overlaps.
<br>
Since 2013, 16 to 17 year olds have been legally required to remain in education and training (at least part-time) in England, but not in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Data for 2020 and 2021 may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
