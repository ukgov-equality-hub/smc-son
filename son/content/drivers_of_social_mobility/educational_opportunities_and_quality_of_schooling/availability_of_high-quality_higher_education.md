Students are counted as dropping out if they left their course in the first year, having attended for 50 days or more.

### Things you need to know
Lower dropout rates may not reflect the availability of good quality higher education. 

Other relevant factors might include changes to wages and job opportunities at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
