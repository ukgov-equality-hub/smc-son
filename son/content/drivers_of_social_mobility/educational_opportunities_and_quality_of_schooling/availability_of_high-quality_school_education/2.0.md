Data on the scores of 15 year old students in the UK and internationally in reading, maths and science, over time.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In 2022, UK students scored above the international average for OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries in reading, maths and science.

In both the UK and OECD countries, scores in reading and maths went down in 2022 compared with 2018. Scores in science went down slightly.

UK students have scored at or above the OECD average since the early 2000s.

## About the data

### Data source
OECD, Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), 2003 to 2022 mathematics, reading and science assessments

### Time period
2003 to 2022

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the performance of 15 year old students in maths, science and reading in the UK, over time. It also shows the international average, measured in [OECD countries](https://www.oecd.org/about/document/ratification-oecd-convention.htm).

### Things you need to know
Due to small sample sizes in the UK, the OECD advises against comparisons between the UK and other countries for the year 2003. There is no data available for the science assessment in 2003.

The data is an alternate measure of opportunities for high-quality school education. It evaluates education systems by their performance and compares them internationally.

PISA scores do not have a maximum or minimum. Instead, they are scaled so that the average score is around 500 points and one standard deviation is around 100 points. Read more about [PISA 2022 results](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/pisa-2022-results-volume-i_53f23881-en.html).

### Type of data
Survey data
