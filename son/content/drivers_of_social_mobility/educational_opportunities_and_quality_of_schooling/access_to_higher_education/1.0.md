### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of 19 year olds entered in higher education in the UK, over time.
It also shows the international average, measured in
[OECD countries](https://www.oecd.org/about/document/ratification-oecd-convention.htm){: target="_blank" }.

The data is based on headcounts and includes both full-time and part-time students.
In some OECD countries, part-time education is only partially covered in the data.

### Things you need to know
Entrance rates in higher education are calculated by dividing the number of students aged 19 years by the size of
the population of 19 year olds.
