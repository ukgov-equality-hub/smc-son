            [203 local authority areas in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area/latest#list-of-uk-regions)
            are put into 5 categories based on their ‘index of labour market opportunities’ composite scores.
            The categories are not equally sized – the middle category is larger because most local authorities are very near the average.
            Areas with the highest scores have the most favourable labour market opportunities.

## Summary main findings
Data for 2018 to 2022 shows that the ‘north-south divide’ for young people's labour market opportunities was clearer than it was for [childhood conditions](/drivers_of_social_mobility/composite_indices/childhood_conditions/latest). 

The most favourable labour market opportunities were in some London boroughs and Bristol. This means young people living there were more likely to be in professional occupations and earn more.

There were fewer local authorities in Scotland and the north west of England among the areas with favourable opportunities, and none in Wales.

Areas with unfavourable opportunities include older industrial and port areas in the north and the midlands, such as Birmingham, Hartlepool, and Sunderland, as well as some mainly rural areas such as Northumberland and the Shetland Islands.

There were also more local authorities with unfavourable conditions in the north east of England.
