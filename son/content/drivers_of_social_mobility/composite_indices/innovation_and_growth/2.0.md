            [205 local authority areas in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area/latest#list-of-uk-regions)
            are put into 7 groups – from ‘most favourable’ to ‘least favourable’ conditions – based on their ‘index of innovation and growth’ composite scores. The categories are not equally sized – the middle category is larger because most local authorities are very near the average.

## Summary main findings
Data for 2018 to 2024 combined shows that the 6 ‘most favourable’ local authority areas for innovation and growth are all in London:

* Camden and City of London
* Westminster
* Islington
* Tower Hamlets
* Hammersmith and Fulham
* Hackney

Many of the local authorities with ‘favourable’ conditions for innovation and growth are in London and its surrounding counties. 

There are also favourable conditions in:

* Edinburgh
* Oxfordshire	
* Reading	
* Bristol
* Wokingham
* Cheshire West and Chester

Many local authorities with less favourable conditions for innovation and growth are in areas formerly known for coal mining and other heavy industries,  or in coastal areas. These include:

* North East Lincolnshire
* Blaenau Gwent
* Redcar and Cleveland
* Doncaster
* North Lincolnshire
* East Ayrshire

Many areas with unfavourable conditions for innovation growth also score poorly for [conditions of childhood](/drivers_of_social_mobility/composite_indices/conditions_of_childhood/latest) and [labour market opportunities for young people](/drivers_of_social_mobility/composite_indices/labour_market_opportunities_for_young_people/latest).

When comparing the most recent data with data from 2000 to 2005, there were only small improvements in conditions for innovation and growth. However, there was some progress both inside and outside of London. Any decline was uncommon and usually small.

## About the data

### Data source(s)
* Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS), 2000 to 2024
* Office for National Statistics, Regional Gross Value Added (GVA) by Industry, 1998 to 2022

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
This page combines data from the following 3 indicators into a single 'composite' score:

* [Postgraduate education](/drivers_of_social_mobility/research_and_development_environment/postgraduate_education/latest)
* [Occupations in the 'new economy'](/drivers_of_social_mobility/research_and_development_environment/occupations_in_the_'new_economy'/latest)
* [Gross value added per capita](/drivers_of_social_mobility/research_and_development_environment/gross_value_added_(gva)_per_capita/latest)

### Things you need to know
Areas are based on where respondents lived at the time they were surveyed, not where they grew up.

The unit used for this index is the 'Z-score'. This is a type of statistical measurement which can be used to tell us how likely it is that a region is different to the UK average. 

The values shown are not percentages, and the difference between regions cannot be compared in percentage terms. 

The Z-scores are used to put regions into one of 7 groups, according to a set of thresholds for each group. See our [technical annex](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-nation-2024-local-to-national-mapping-opportunities-for-all/technical-annex) for more information on how each area was scored.
