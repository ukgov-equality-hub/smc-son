            [203 local authority areas in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area/latest#list-of-uk-regions)
            are put into 5 groups  – from ‘most favourable’ to ‘least favourable’ conditions – based on their ‘index of innovation and growth’ composite scores.
            The categories are not equally sized – the middle category is larger because most local authorities are very near the average.

## Summary main findings
The 6 ‘most favourable’ local authority areas for innovation and growth are all in London:

* Camden and City of London
* Hammersmith and Fulham
* Kensington and Chelsea
* Richmond upon Thames
* Wandsworth
* Westminster

Many of the local authorities with ‘favourable’ environments for innovation and growth are in London and the ‘home counties’ (the counties surrounding London).

There are also favourable environments in:

* Cambridgeshire
* Cardiff
* Milton Keynes
* Slough
* Southampton
* Warrington

Many local authorities with the least favourable environments for innovation and growth are in rural areas. These include:

* Isle of Anglesey
* Caerphilly
* Ceredigion
* Cornwall and Isles of Scilly
* Highland
* Lincolnshire
* Na h-Eileanan Siar (Outer Hebrides)
* Orkney Islands
* Pembrokeshire
* Powys
* Scottish Borders

This is expected given that we have included ‘gigabit’ capability as one of the drivers of innovation and growth. But both the other drivers for this index also show strong differences between urban and rural areas.
