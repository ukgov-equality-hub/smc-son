## About the data

### Data source(s)
Office for National Statistics, Vacancy Survey and Labour Force Survey

### Time period
2001 to 2024

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the number of vacancies for every unemployed person in the UK. A higher value indicates greater opportunities for job seekers.

The vacancy rate is based on:

* the number of unemployed people aged 16 to 64
* the number of vacancies

All estimates are based on data for October to December each year.

Rates are rounded to 1 decimal place.

### Things you need to know
Figures are seasonally adjusted to account for variations during the year. Read more about [seasonal adjustment](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/seasonaladjustment) from ONS.

These findings are different from those in last yearâ€™s report. This is because the previous figures have been revised.
