## By area

        #### Percentage of 16 to 24 year olds who were unemployed, by region (UK, 2014 to 2022 combined) {: class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"}

        [41 regions in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area#the-41-regions) are ranked from the lowest to highest percentages.
        They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        
        The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions.
        
        The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
        – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within.
        In many cases the confidence intervals overlap.
        This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
        
        See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to
        understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
2014 to 2022

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows unemployment rates for 16 to 24 year olds in the UK.

Unemployment is measured as the percentage of ‘economically active’ 16 to 24 year olds who are currently out of work but looking for a job or waiting to start one.

Rates are rounded to whole numbers.

### Things you need to know
The data does not include people who are economically inactive because they are either:

* in full-time education
* looking after the home
* permanently sick or disabled

Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).


### Type of data
Survey data
