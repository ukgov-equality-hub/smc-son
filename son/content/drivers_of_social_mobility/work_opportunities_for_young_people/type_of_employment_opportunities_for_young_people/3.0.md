Data on the occupational level of 22 to 29 year olds in the UK, from 2014 to 2024.

[TOC]

## Summary main findings

In the last decade, there has been an increase in professional employment opportunities for young people.

From 2014 to 2024:

* the percentage of 22 to 29 year olds in professional and managerial jobs went up from 38% to 49%
* the percentage in higher working class jobs (skilled manual work) went down from 25% to 17%

The combined data for 2014 to 2024 shows that young people in London and the South East were:

* more likely to work in higher professional occupations than those in other parts of the UK
* far less likely to work in lower working occupations

        #### Percentage of 22 to 29 year olds in lower working and higher professional occupations, by area (UK, 2014 to 2024 combined)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Office for National Statistics (ONS), Labour Force Survey (LFS)

### Time period
* 2014 to 2024 (By year)
* 2014 to 2024 combined (By area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the occupation level of employed 22 to 29 year olds in the UK between 2014 and 2024. It also shows data by region.

### Things you need to know
Socio-economic background is based on the main earner’s occupation when the respondent was 14 years old. If there was no earner in the family, respondents are included in the lower working class category.

Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.

### Type of data
