        #### Business spending on research and development, by region over time (UK, 2007 to 2018) {: class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"}

        [41 regions in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area#the-41-regions) are ranked from the lowest to highest spending.
        They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        
        The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions.
        
        See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to
        understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Nesta Research & Development spatial data tool, 2021.

### Time period
2007 to 2018

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows changes in business spending on research and development in the UK between 2007 and 2018.
It also shows average spending for 41 regions of the UK.

### Things you need to know
Nesta data includes regional scores but not a national average figure.
To track changes over time, we use the broadband speed for the median UK area each year.

The median is the middle point of a range of numbers which are arranged in order.
In this case, the median area is the area ranked 21st out of the 41 regions in the UK.

### Type of data
