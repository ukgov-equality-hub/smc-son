## Summary main findings

There were large drops in GVA in 2009 and 2020 due to the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In 2023, Inner London West had the highest GVA per capita out of all UK regions, at £250,416. Outer East and North East London had the lowest, at £22,522.

## About the data

### Data source
Regional gross value added (balanced) per head and income components, Office for National Statistics (ONS)

### Time period
* 1998 to 2023 (By year)
* 2023 (By area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows gross value added (GVA) adjusted for the size of the population.
 
GVA measures the increase in the value of the economy due to the production of goods and services. 

For more information on how ONS produces its GVA estimates, please see the [State of the Nation 2025 technical annex](). 

### Things you need to know
This page was published for the first time for State of the Nation 2025

Earnings have been adjusted for inflation using 2022 as the base year.

The regions used in the analysis by area are different to the regions used in other data on this website. This is because ONS updated the regions in 2025.

GVA is based on the region where the business is located, not where its employees live.

Estimates for Highlands and Islands and Southern Scotland are not available due to uncertainty in the ONS population estimates.

### Type of data
