        #### Percentage of adults in families with dependent children with a higher education qualification, by region (UK, 2014 to 2021 combined) {: class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-4"}

        [41 regions in the UK](/social_mobility_by_area#the-41-regions) are ranked from the lowest to highest percentages.
        They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
        
        The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions.
        
        The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)
        – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within.
        In many cases the confidence intervals overlap.
        This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
        
        See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to
        understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Labour Force Survey (LFS), Office for National Statistics.

### Time period
2014 to 2022

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the education levels of adults in families with dependent children. Dependent children are classed as all children aged 15 and under, and 16 to 18 year olds in full-time education.

The education levels are:

* lower level (below CSE grade 1)
* O level, GCSE and equivalent
* A level and equivalent
* further education (below degree level)
* higher education (degree level and above)

### Things you need to know
The data for people with below degree level qualifications in 2022 is not directly comparable to previous years. This is due to a change in the LFS methodology.

The average age of survey respondents was 40 years old. The majority of respondents are likely to be the parents or carers of dependent children. Some could be adults living in homes with parents who have dependent children.

Respondents aged under 21 years old were not included.

Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)

### Type of data
Survey data
