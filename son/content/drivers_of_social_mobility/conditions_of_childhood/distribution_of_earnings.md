Summary main findings

## Text
Inequality in hourly pay between high and low earners got narrower between 2010 and 2022.<br>
From 1997 to 2011, ‘high earners’ (people in the 90th percentile for hourly pay) earned around 4 times as much as ‘low earners’ (people in the 10th percentile).<br>
Inequality in hourly pay then went down every year over the next 10 years. In 2022, higher earners earned around 3.1 times as much as low earners.<br>
Inequality in hourly pay was higher in England than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

## About the data
# Data source
ONS, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).

# Time period
1997 to 2022

# Geographic area
UK

# What the data measures
<p class="govuk-body">The data measures the gap in hourly earnings between people at the:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list list-disc">
    <li>90th percentile (‘high earners’) – they earn more than 90% of people</li>
    <li>10th percentile (‘low earners’) – they earn less than 90% of people</li>
</ul>

The ‘90:10 ratio’ is calculated as income at the 90th percentile divided by income at the 10th percentile. For example, a ratio of 2 means that people at the 90th percentile earn twice as much as people at the 10th percentile.

# Things you need to know
This data uses the ‘90:10 ratio’ rather than the Gini coefficient (a commonly-used measure of income inequality). This is for ease of understanding. It uses data from ASHE instead of other sources because ASHE includes data on regional differences.
