## About the data

### Data source
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Households Below Average Income statistics

### Time period
1994 to 2023

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of children living in households in relative poverty after housing costs in the UK.

A household is in relative poverty if their equivalised income is below 60% of the median income for all households in the UK. ‘Equivalised’ means adjusted for the number and ages of the people living in the household.

### Things you need to know
Data is calculated using 3-year averages. For example, the figure for 2022 represents the average of the financial years starting in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals).
