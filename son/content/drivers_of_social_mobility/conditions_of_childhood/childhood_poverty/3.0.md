## About the data

### Data source

April 1996 to March 2024 (28 financial years)

### Geographic area

### What the data measures
The data shows the percentage of children living in households in relative poverty after housing costs in the UK and its 4 nations

A household is in relative poverty if their equivalised income is below 60% of the median income for all households in the UK. ‘Equivalised’ means adjusted for the number and ages of the people living in the household.

### Things you need to know
The data covers financial years running from April through to March (for example, 2023/24 relates to the financial year April 2023 to March 2024).

Data is calculated using 3-year averages. For example, the figure for 2023/24 represents the average of the 3 financial years between April 2021 and March 2024.
