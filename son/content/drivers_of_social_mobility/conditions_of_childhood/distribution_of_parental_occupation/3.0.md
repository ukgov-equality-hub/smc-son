        #### Percentage of adults in families with dependent children in a lower working class or higher professional occupation, by region (UK, 2014 to 2024 combined)

        ::: inset_text classes="govuk-!-margin-top-3"
            41 regions in the UK are ranked from the lowest to highest values. They are then divided into 5 equally-sized groups (‘quintiles’), from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
            
            The lines either side of the dots represent [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals) – the range of values that the 'true' value for each region is highly likely to be within. In many cases the confidence intervals overlap. This suggests differences between specific regions may not be statistically significant.
            
            The regional estimates have a large margin of error – do not rank or compare specific regions. See the [composite indices](/social_mobility_by_area#composite-measures-by-region) for more precise estimates and to understand overall regional patterns.

## About the data

### Data source
Labour Force Survey (LFS), Office for National Statistics

### Time period
* 2014 to 2024 (By year)
* 2014 to 2024 combined (By area)

### Geographic area
UK

### What the data measures
The data shows the occupation levels of adults in families with dependent children. Dependent children are all children aged 15 and under, and 16 to 18 year olds in full-time education. Adult respondents under 21 years old were not included.

The occupation levels are:

* higher professional
* lower professional
* intermediate
* higher working
* lower working

### Things you need to know
The median age of survey respondents was 40 years old. The majority of respondents are likely to be the parents or carers of dependent children. Some could be adults living in homes with parents who have dependent children.

Data is weighted using LFS person weights.

Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.

The error bars show 95% confidence intervals. Read more about [confidence intervals](/about-our-analysis#confidence-intervals)

### Type of data
Survey data
